# ME766-Project
Helmholtz equation is a PDE in space and time. It often arises in the study of physical problems. One such problem is propagation of matter waves. The project aims to solve the Helmholtz equation using the finite difference method. PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for scalable solution for scientific applications. The project aims to implement the finite difference method of solving the Helmholtz equation using PETSc and scale it for GPU accelerators using the OpenCL library and quantitatively conduct a convergence and speed up study. *It is further desired that the project incorporates tools like METIS(PAR METIS) for an optimized decomposition of the problem domain.
